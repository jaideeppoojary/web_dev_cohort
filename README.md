# Why git ?
Have you ever wondered how so many developers' code is managed or how changes are rolled back when something goes wrong? That's where Git comes in! Git helps developers collaborate, track changes, and keep everything running smoothly.

But here's an interesting question - Is Git really necessary? Absolutely! Without Git, managing code changes and collaborating in a team would be chaotic.

You might ask, Why is Git required? Well in simple, Git makes it easy to track every change made to the code, allowing teams to work together without overwriting each other's work.

> GitHub is a platform where you can store and share your Git repositories. It helps teams work together on projects. You can see each other's changes, leave comments, and suggest improvements.
