# Welcome Devs! Your Git & GitHubÂ Guide

Hello and welcome!  This document is your guide to using Git and GitHub effectively at ChaiCode. Whether you're a beginner or have some experience, this guide will help you understand how we work with Git and GitHub for version control and team collaboration. By the end of this guide, you'll be comfortable using Git and GitHub for your day-to-day work.

# Why gitÂ ?
Have you ever wondered how so many developers' code is managed or how changes are rolled back when something goes wrong? That's where Git comes in! Git helps developers collaborate, track changes, and keep everything running smoothly.

But here's an interesting questionâ€Š-â€ŠIs Git really necessary? Absolutely! Without Git, managing code changes and collaborating in a team would be chaotic.

You might ask, Why is Git required? Well in simple, Git makes it easy to track every change made to the code, allowing teams to work together without overwriting each other's work.

> GitHub is a platform where you can store and share your Git repositories. It helps teams work together on projects. You can see each other's changes, leave comments, and suggest improvements.


Ok, let's startâ€¦ðŸ”¥

# Commit MessageÂ Rules
While saving the changes using the git commit command you should follow rules. So that while see the commit history it should be easily untestable by others.

When writing commit messages, follow these simple rules:

1. **Use present tense**: Write "Add feature" instead of "Added feature".
2. **Capitalize the first letter** of the message.
3. **Keep it short and to the point** (50 characters or less).
4. **Use prefixes for categorization**, such as:

* `feat`: for new features
* `fix`: for bug fixes
* `chore`: for general updates
* `docs`: for documentation updates

### Example commit messages:
```
  feat: Add tea selection feature
  fix: Resolve login issue for tea lovers
  docs: Update README with chai varieties
```
