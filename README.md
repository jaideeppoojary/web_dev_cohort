Whether you're a beginner or have some experience, this guide will help you understand how we work with Git and GitHub for version control and team collaboration. By the end of this guide, you'll be comfortable using Git and GitHub for your day-to-day work.

# Why gitÂ ?
Have you ever wondered how so many developers' code is managed or how changes are rolled back when something goes wrong? That's where Git comes in! Git helps developers collaborate, track changes, and keep everything running smoothly.

But here's an interesting questionâ€Š-â€ŠIs Git really necessary? Absolutely! Without Git, managing code changes and collaborating in a team would be chaotic.

You might ask, Why is Git required? Well in simple, Git makes it easy to track every change made to the code, allowing teams to work together without overwriting each other's work.

> GitHub is a platform where you can store and share your Git repositories. It helps teams work together on projects. You can see each other's changes, leave comments, and suggest improvements.


Ok, let's startâ€¦ðŸ”¥
